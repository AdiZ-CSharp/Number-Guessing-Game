# Number-Guessing-Game
A console-run number guessing-game creating in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and written in C#.


The Program.cs file and the Program 17.csproj are included, feel free to do whatever you want with them (including changing the first three variables in the code, that's just there for a tutorial I was doing), as detailed in the attached LICENSE file. This was made to help beginners with coding in C#, and to make sure I don't lose my earliest games, so I can look back at how inefficient I was xD

Hope this helps!
